## 🔍 Why Your Site Isn't Showing in Google Yet:

Your website is **BRAND NEW** to Google. It needs to be:
1. **Indexed** - Google needs to discover and add your site to their database
2. **Ranked** - Google needs time to determine where to rank your site (takes weeks/months)

**Timeline:**
- ⏰ **First appearance:** 1-7 days (if you submit to Google)
- ⏰ **Good ranking:** 3-6 months (with good SEO practices)
